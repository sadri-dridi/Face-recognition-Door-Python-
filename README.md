# Face-recognition-Door-Python-
Proposed a face recognition door lock system using raspberry pi, Pi camera Raspberry, and Pi platform.  Coded in Python using Open CV libraries, the Haar classifier method for face detection (an accurate and clear picture of an intruder),  Installed a Pi camera that captures the image and compares the face to the database images.

Assuming that you already have a database of known faces and their corresponding labels, the following is a simple algorithm for a face-recognition door in Python:

Use a camera to capture an image of the person standing in front of the door.

Use a face detection algorithm to detect the face in the captured image.

Extract the features of the detected face using a feature extraction algorithm (such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)).

Compare the extracted features to the features of the known faces in your database using a similarity measure (such as Euclidean distance or cosine similarity).

If the similarity between the extracted features and one of the known faces is above a certain threshold, consider the person to be a match and open the door. Otherwise, consider the person to be unknown and do not open the door.

Here is a sample implementation of this algorithm in Python:
