# Face Recognition Door Lock System Using Python and Raspberry Pi

## Overview
This project presents a face recognition-based door lock system leveraging the power of Raspberry Pi and the Pi Camera. Utilizing the Python programming language and OpenCV libraries, this system implements the Haar classifier method for precise and reliable face detection.

## Key Features
- **Accurate Face Detection**: Employing the Haar classifier method for high accuracy.
- **Pi Camera Integration**: Captures images and compares faces against a pre-existing database.
- **Python-Based**: Coded in Python, leveraging OpenCV for image processing.

## System Algorithm
The system follows a straightforward algorithm for face recognition:
1. **Image Capture**: Uses a camera to take a picture of the person at the door.
2. **Face Detection**: Employs a face detection algorithm on the captured image.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Extracts facial features using methods like PCA or LDA.
4. **Database Comparison**: Compares extracted features with known faces in the database using similarity measures.
5. **Decision Making**: Unlocks the door if a match is found above a set threshold; otherwise, access is denied.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Hardware Setup**
   - Raspberry Pi with Raspbian OS.
   - Pi Camera Module.
   - Additional components for the door locking mechanism.

2. **Software Requirements**
   - Python 3.x.
   - OpenCV Library.
   - Necessary dependencies (e.g., NumPy).

3. **Face Detection**
   - Capture image via Pi Camera.
   - Utilize Haar Cascade Classifier for detection.

4. **Face Recognition**
   - Feature extraction with PCA/LDA.
   - Compare features against the database.

5. **Decision Making**
   - Door unlocks if a known face is recognized.
   - Maintains security if no match is found.

6. **Database Management**
   - Management of a database containing known faces and labels.

## Sample Python Implementation
```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
# Additional imports may be required for database management and GPIO control

# Initialize Pi Camera (Assuming the camera setup and configuration is done)
# camera = PiCamera()

# Load Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection
face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')

# Function to capture image and detect face
def capture_and_detect_face():
    # Capture image from camera
    # camera.capture('current_image.jpg')
    image = cv2.imread('current_image.jpg')
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

    # Detect face
    faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, 1.1, 4)
    for (x, y, w, h) in faces:
        face_roi = gray[y:y+h, x:x+w]
        return face_roi
    return None

# Function for face recognition (simplified version)
def recognize_face(face_roi, database):
    # Feature extraction and comparison logic goes here
    # Compare with database entries
    # Return True if match found else False
    pass

# Main logic
face_roi = capture_and_detect_face()
if face_roi is not None:
    if recognize_face(face_roi, database):
        print("Face recognized, unlocking the door.")
        # Code to unlock the door
    else:
        print("Unknown face, keeping the door locked.")
else:
    print("No face detected.")

```
(Note: This is a basic implementation serving as a starting point. Customization required for specific hardware setups.)

## Considerations
- Initial stage implementation; further development required.
- Integration with the database and door lock mechanism is necessary.
- Inclusion of security features like anti-spoofing is recommended.
